# NSSL EFM Tracker PCB

The tracker provides GPS location data to instrument operators via a satellite  
connection. It is designed to enable easy location of the instrument package during  
and after flight, supporting both flight termination decisions and efficient recovery  
of the full payload. The tracker uses a progressive rate strategy to optimize battery  
life, providing high-rate position updates during the most dynamic and critical phases  
of the flight.

See the [main instrument repo](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/NSSL_EFM_Instrument)
for documentation and the rest of the instrument.
